Creating practice test questions for an introduction to Python class that covers Big-O notation can be quite effective for helping students understand algorithmic complexity and efficiency. Here are five questions that range from basic understanding to application:

1. **Basic Definition Matching:**
   - **Question:** Match the following Big-O notations with their corresponding descriptions:
     - **A. O(1)**
     - **B. O(n)**
     - **C. O(n^2)**
     - **D. O(log n)**

     1. This notation describes an algorithm that takes the same amount of time to run regardless of the size of the input data.
     2. This notation describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data.
     3. This notation describes an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data.
     4. This notation describes an algorithm that increases logarithmically; it becomes slower the larger the input size becomes, but it scales very efficiently.


2. **Understanding Complexity in Code:**
   - **Question:** Consider the following Python function:
     ```python
     def find_element(elements, key):
         for item in elements:
             if item == key:
                 return True
         return False
     ```
     What is the time complexity of this function in Big-O notation?

 
3. **Algorithm Comparison:**
   - **Question:** Which of the following algorithms is more efficient in terms of time complexity for searching an element in a sorted list of `n` elements?
     - **A.** A linear search algorithm
     - **B.** A binary search algorithm

 
4. **Applying Big-O to Real Problems:**
   - **Question:** You have a list of `n` student names and you need to check if a particular name, `John Doe`, exists in the list. You have two algorithms:
     - **Algorithm A:** Sorts the list first and then uses a binary search.
     - **Algorithm B:** Uses a linear search without sorting.
     What is the most time-efficient algorithm for this task and why?

 
5. **Complexity Analysis in Nested Loops:**
   - **Question:** What is the time complexity of the following Python function?
     ```python
     def print_pairs(year1_lists,year2_lists):
         for list1 in year1_lists:
             for list2 in year2_lists:
                 find("apple",list1 + list2)
     ```
  
These questions are designed to help students conceptualize and apply Big-O notation in various contexts, reinforcing their understanding of algorithm efficiency.
