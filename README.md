**Redesigned Regional Partner Network: Comprehensive Proposal**

---

**Vision & Purpose**

The redesigned Regional Partner (RP) Network is built to transition Code.org's model from one focused primarily on transactional delivery of professional development to a strategic partnership model. This model positions RPs as:

- Champions of computer science (CS) education across their states and regions.
- Strategic collaborators with districts, supporting systems-level change.
- Localized experts in both implementation and demand generation.

Through this evolution, RPs are no longer seen solely as providers of workshops, but as leaders of strategic planning, marketing, and community engagement in support of sustainable CS education.

**Core Partner Roles**

To fulfill this vision, RPs will take on expanded and differentiated responsibilities:

1. **Demand Generation and Local Marketing**
   - Drive awareness of Code.org's offerings through regionally tailored campaigns.
   - Leverage marketing grants to support visibility at conferences and convenings.
   - Engage school and district leaders through storytelling, success metrics, and strategic messaging.

2. **Strategic District Engagement**
   - Serve as consultants to districts, supporting the development and implementation of CS plans.
   - Lead strategic conversations and facilitate alignment between district priorities and CS opportunities.
   - Recruit districts into the Code.org District Program and support their long-term success.

3. **Professional Learning Delivery**
   - Continue to deliver high-quality, standards-aligned PD for K-12 teachers.
   - Recruit and support facilitators to ensure regional delivery capacity.
   - Explore integration of PD offerings into broader district coaching or curriculum efforts.

4. **Ongoing Support Services**
   - Offer ongoing, non-cost-incurring support such as virtual office hours, light-touch coaching, and implementation check-ins.
   - Help launch PLCs, resource hubs, and community-building spaces for CS educators.

**Incentive Structures**

To encourage and reward these expanded roles, the following incentive mechanisms will be implemented:

1. **Performance-Based Incentives**
   - Tied to strategic outcomes, such as:
     - District Program onboarding
     - Strategic planning completion
     - Implementation milestones (new courses, policies, staffing, etc.)
     - Teacher implementation metrics
     - Managing regional coach cohorts (for the Code.org Coach Network)
   - Incentives range from $300–$5,000 depending on the outcome area.
   - Capped per RP annually to ensure equitable access across the network.

2. **Recognition Opportunities**
   - Spotlight high-impact partners through:
     - Annual awards at national summits
     - Case studies and success stories
     - Rotating feature in newsletters and digital channels

3. **Marketing Grants**
   - Dedicated pool of $250,000 in annual funding to support local outreach.
   - Proposals reviewed quarterly; criteria include alignment with engagement goals and anticipated reach.
   - Can be used by RP staff, facilitators, or designated champions.

**Conclusion**

This redesigned RP Network model supports a modern, resilient, and strategic infrastructure for scaling computer science education across the United States. By recognizing and resourcing the unique strengths of local partners—and funding them to lead district-level change and engagement—Code.org ensures that its mission is not just implemented, but embedded and sustained in every corner of the country.
