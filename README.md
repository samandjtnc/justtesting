### Project Scope for the New Funding Model

**Project Title:**
New Funding Model for Regional Partner Network Redesign

**Project Sponsor:**
Code.org

**Project Description:**
This project aims to develop and implement a new funding model for Code.org's Regional Partners that supports the transition to a district-centric engagement model. The funding model will prioritize direct work with districts over individual teacher recruitment and will introduce innovative funding mechanisms that include grant models with performance incentives, cost recovery models, and matching funds to leverage district investments.

**Project Objectives:**
1. To establish a sustainable funding model that supports the strategic focus on district-level engagements.
2. To incentivize RPs to initiate and maintain high-quality district engagements.
3. To encourage districts to co-invest in their computer science education initiatives, enhancing sustainability and impact.
4. To ensure transparent and equitable distribution of funds across different tiers of RPs based on their engagement level and performance.

**Scope Details:**

**Inclusions:**
- Development of a detailed grant model with upfront seed funding and additional performance-based incentives (SPIF).
- Design of a cost recovery plus model that covers direct costs and a percentage for overhead for RPs.
- Implementation of a matching funds mechanism where Code.org matches district investments in professional learning and other initiatives.
- Integration of these funding models with the tiered RP system, ensuring that funding aligns with the roles and capacities of different tiers.
- Creation of clear guidelines and criteria for funding eligibility, distribution, and reporting requirements.

**Exclusions:**
- Direct funding models that primarily focus on individual teacher recruitment and engagement.
- Funding mechanisms that do not promote sustainability or district co-investment.
- Involvement in non-strategic, low-impact engagements that do not align with the district-centric model.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Funding model framework document detailing all aspects of grant, cost recovery, and matching funds models.
- A system for tracking, reporting, and evaluating the impact of funded initiatives to ensure compliance and effectiveness.
- Training materials and guidelines for RPs to understand and implement the new funding models.
- A digital dashboard or platform for managing funding requests, distributions, and performance tracking.

**Milestones:**
1. **Initial Framework Design:** Completion of the initial funding model framework.
2. **Stakeholder Review and Feedback:** Gather feedback from key stakeholders including RPs, district representatives, and funding partners.
3. **Finalization and Approval:** Finalize the funding models based on feedback and obtain approval from the Code.org board.
4. **Implementation and Roll-out:** Begin phased implementation of the funding models, starting with pilot regions.
5. **Ongoing Evaluation and Adjustment:** Regularly review the effectiveness of the funding models and make necessary adjustments.

**Success Criteria:**
- Successful implementation of the funding models in selected pilot regions within the first year.
- Positive feedback from RPs and district partners on the transparency and effectiveness of the funding process.
- Measurable increase in district engagements and co-investments in computer science education initiatives.
- Alignment of funding distributions with the strategic goals of increasing district-level impacts.

**Budget:**
- Detailed budget planning based on the expected costs of developing, implementing, and maintaining the new funding models.

**Assumptions:**
- Adequate buy-in from RPs and district partners regarding the new funding models.
- Sufficient initial funding available to seed the grant and matching funds models.

**Constraints:**
- Limited initial funding may restrict the scale of the pilot implementations.
- Variability in district financial capacities to co-invest in the programs.


### 1. **Grant Model with Performance Incentives**
- **Description**: This model involves providing upfront seed funding to RPs to initiate district-level engagement projects. The funding is aimed at covering the initial costs of setting up and piloting new district programs or expanding existing ones.
- **Performance Incentives (SPIF)**: To encourage active and successful engagements, RPs could receive additional financial incentives based on specific performance metrics such as the number of districts successfully onboarded, the engagement level of these districts, or the achievement of predetermined milestones within the district programs.
- **Benefits**: Encourages RPs to actively seek and maintain high-quality district engagements, aligning with the goal of broader and deeper integration of computer science education.
- **Considerations**: Performance metrics need to be clearly defined and aligned with the strategic goals of both Code.org and the RPs. This model requires robust tracking and reporting systems to monitor progress and determine incentive payouts.

### 2. **Cost Recovery Plus Model**
- **Description**: In this model, RPs are funded to cover the direct costs of delivering workshops and other services, plus an additional percentage to cover overhead and administrative expenses.
- **Structure**: RPs would submit detailed cost reports for the services provided, and funding would be allocated based on these costs plus an additional agreed-upon percentage to cover overhead. This percentage would be determined based on typical overhead costs for similar programs and the specific needs of the RP.
- **Benefits**: Provides a clear and transparent funding structure that covers necessary expenses and acknowledges the operational costs RPs incur, encouraging sustainability.
- **Considerations**: Requires accurate and timely financial reporting from RPs. There might be a need for periodic audits or reviews to ensure compliance and proper use of funds.

### 3. **Matching Funds Model**
- **Description**: This model leverages district investments by matching funds provided by districts for workshops and programs. It encourages districts to invest in their computer science education initiatives, with Code.org and its RPs providing matching funds to extend the impact of district dollars.
- **Structure**: For every dollar a district invests in PL workshops or other initiatives, Code.org could match this amount up to a certain cap. The matching ratio and cap could vary based on the district's size, needs, or the strategic importance of the engagement.
- **Benefits**: Promotes district buy-in and investment in computer science education, potentially leading to more sustainable and long-term engagements. It also stretches the impact of Code.org funds by requiring district skin in the game.
- **Considerations**: Requires clear guidelines on what costs are eligible for matching and the maximum match amounts. This model also needs a system to verify district contributions and manage disbursements.
