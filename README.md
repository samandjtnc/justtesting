## **IV. Transformation Context: RP Status and Plans (2023‚Äì24 and Beyond)**

In 2023‚Äì24, Code.org initiated the first major transformation of the RP Network in nearly a decade. Key shifts included a transition from transactional professional development delivery to strategic district engagement, the launch of a $250,000 annual marketing grant program, testing of outcome-based incentive programs, and the assignment of new responsibilities around systems consulting and ongoing district support. Early results show increased district engagement and higher visibility of RPs in their respective regions.

---

## **V. Redesigned Regional Partner Network: Comprehensive Proposal**

### **Vision & Purpose**
The redesigned RPN envisions partners not just as implementers, but as regional leaders who champion CS education, strategically engage districts, and support long-term sustainability through community engagement and demand generation.

### **Core Partner Roles**

#### 1. **Demand Generation and Local Marketing**
To address the network's limited marketing expertise, each RP will take ownership of regionally tailored campaigns designed to build awareness of Code.org offerings and the broader value of CS education. These campaigns will include strategic participation in conferences, branded materials, and localized storytelling using data snapshots and videos. By engaging directly with district decision-makers and influencers, RPs can elevate the visibility of computer science as a priority. The goal is to increase inbound interest from districts, measured through the number of new district leads entered into the CRM and the volume of engagement activities. An annual fund of $250,000 will be available, with up to $5,000 per RP per quarter to offset costs related to marketing campaigns, conferences, or storytelling development.

#### 2. **Strategic District Engagement**
RPs will act as strategic consultants to districts, leading conversations that align Code.org offerings with district goals and challenges. This is critical in overcoming the legacy teacher-centric focus noted in the SWOT analysis. RPs will be expected to facilitate district planning sessions, help develop multi-year computer science implementation plans, and onboard districts into Code.org's District Program. The intended outcome is to establish sustained district partnerships with defined implementation milestones. Success will be measured by the number of districts onboarded, completion of CS implementation plans, and the launch of new CS courses. Code.org will provide planning templates and case study exemplars to guide this work.

#### 3. **Professional Learning Delivery**
RPs will continue to deliver high-quality professional development but will also integrate these offerings into broader district professional learning ecosystems. Facilitator networks will be grown and supported to meet regional capacity needs. This evolution supports role differentiation, recognizing that not all RPs will focus equally on PD delivery. Implementation fidelity and reach will be tracked by teacher participation, workshop completion rates, and course adoption post-training. A robust facilitator support system will include ongoing training, stipends for workshop delivery, and access to facilitation resources.

#### 4. **Ongoing Support Services**
To build deeper trust and sustainability, RPs will provide a suite of lightweight, ongoing services such as virtual office hours, coaching calls, community forums, and resource hubs. These offerings help mitigate district fatigue by providing just-in-time support and creating a sense of continuity. Implementation health will be monitored via quarterly check-ins logged in the CRM, teacher feedback surveys, and district satisfaction scores. Code.org will allocate microgrants or stipends to compensate RP staff for their time managing these services.

### **Incentive Structures**

#### 1. **Performance-Based Incentives**
To reinforce alignment between RP efforts and Code.org‚Äôs strategic goals, a performance-based incentive model will reward partners for achieving key milestones such as onboarding districts, completing CS plans, launching new courses, or managing regional coaching cohorts. These outcomes are directly tied to overcoming the teacher-centric legacy and promoting systems-level change. Incentives will range from $300 to $5,000 depending on the milestone, with data validated via CRM entries and confirmation from Code.org‚Äôs Partner Team. Metrics will include the number of implementation milestones reached, course launches tracked through survey follow-up, and participation in coaching networks.

#### 2. **Recognition Opportunities**
To elevate high-impact work, Code.org will spotlight RPs through newsletters, social media, and the annual partner summit. Recognition is both a motivational tool and a means of knowledge sharing, enabling other RPs to learn from successful strategies. Selection for recognition will be based on performance metrics, narrative impact reports, and marketing content submissions.

#### 3. **Marketing Grants**
Marketing grants will support the demand generation role. These grants are critical to address the identified weakness in marketing expertise and the opportunity to scale awareness through storytelling. RPs will submit quarterly proposals outlining campaign goals, target audiences, budgets, and success metrics such as audience reach, materials distributed, leads generated, or event attendance. Grants will be capped at $5,000 per RP per quarter, with allocations managed centrally by Code.org.

### **Access and Application Process**
All RP staff, facilitators, and approved local champions will be eligible to access incentives and grants. A lightweight application process will ensure proposals include a clearly defined objective, audience description, and anticipated outcomes. Code.org will evaluate submissions on alignment with strategic priorities, potential reach, and past performance indicators.

This strategy supports a more balanced and resilient RP Network‚Äîone where partners are empowered not just to deliver content, but to drive systems change, influence local priorities, and grow computer science education sustainably from the ground up.





**Redesigned Regional Partner Network: Comprehensive Proposal**

---

**Vision & Purpose**

The redesigned Regional Partner (RP) Network is built to transition Code.org's model from one focused primarily on transactional delivery of professional development to a strategic partnership model. This model positions RPs as:

- Champions of computer science (CS) education across their states and regions.
- Strategic collaborators with districts, supporting systems-level change.
- Localized experts in both implementation and demand generation.

Through this evolution, RPs are no longer seen solely as providers of workshops, but as leaders of strategic planning, marketing, and community engagement in support of sustainable CS education.

---

**Core Partner Roles**

To fulfill this vision, RPs will take on expanded and differentiated responsibilities:

1. **Demand Generation and Local Marketing**
   - Drive awareness of Code.org's offerings through regionally tailored campaigns.
   - Leverage marketing grants to support visibility at conferences and convenings.
   - Engage school and district leaders through storytelling, success metrics, and strategic messaging.

2. **Strategic District Engagement**
   - Serve as consultants to districts, supporting the development and implementation of CS plans.
   - Lead strategic conversations and facilitate alignment between district priorities and CS opportunities.
   - Recruit districts into the Code.org District Program and support their long-term success.

3. **Professional Learning Delivery**
   - Continue to deliver high-quality, standards-aligned PD for K-12 teachers.
   - Recruit and support facilitators to ensure regional delivery capacity.
   - Explore integration of PD offerings into broader district coaching or curriculum efforts.

4. **Ongoing Support Services**
   - Offer ongoing, non-cost-incurring support such as virtual office hours, light-touch coaching, and implementation check-ins.
   - Help launch PLCs, resource hubs, and community-building spaces for CS educators.

---

**Incentive Structures**

To encourage and reward these expanded roles, the following incentive mechanisms will be implemented:

1. **Performance-Based Incentives**
   - Tied to strategic outcomes, such as:
     - District Program onboarding
     - Strategic planning completion
     - Implementation milestones (new courses, policies, staffing, etc.)
     - Teacher implementation metrics
     - Managing regional coach cohorts (for the Code.org Coach Network)
   - Incentives range from $300‚Äì$5,000 depending on the outcome area.
   - Capped per RP annually to ensure equitable access across the network.

2. **Recognition Opportunities**
   - Spotlight high-impact partners through:
     - Annual awards at national summits
     - Case studies and success stories
     - Rotating feature in newsletters and digital channels

3. **Marketing Grants**
   - Dedicated pool of $250,000 in annual funding to support local outreach.
   - Proposals reviewed quarterly; criteria include alignment with engagement goals and anticipated reach.
   - Can be used by RP staff, facilitators, or designated champions.
