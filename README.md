# **Prerequisites** {#prerequisites}

The Code.org CSAIF curriculum is designed for high school students at any level of computer science experience. It is accessible to beginners with no prior programming knowledge, and it also provides opportunities for students with some background in computing to deepen their understanding of key topics.

This curriculum can serve as an introductory course or as a bridge to more advanced studies, such as AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) or AP Computer Science A (CSA).

No specific prior coursework is required, and all necessary concepts are introduced and reinforced through guided activities, collaborative learning, and hands-on projects.

# **Our Vision** {#our-vision}

Code.org's vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science ([code.org/about](https://code.org/about)). Our curriculum is designed so that an empowered teacher can lead a diverse group of students through experiences that are supportive, equitable, engaging, and lead to valuable learning ([code.org/educate/curriculum/values](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/values)).

Historically, this vision has contrasted sharply with reality. Until recently, most schools did not offer computer science, and schools that did offer computer science did not have enrollment that matched the demographics of their school population. Additionally, many students found these classes unengaging, intimidating, or disconnected from their lived experiences with technology. Thanks to efforts by many organizations and individuals, this world is beginning to change: many more schools now offer computer science courses; the diversity of schools enrolled in those courses is increasing; and more engaging, relevant, and equitable pedagogy has become the established norm. Even so, there is much work still to be done. This course is designed to continue this momentum as the collective CS education community moves towards this vision of an equitable CS education system.
