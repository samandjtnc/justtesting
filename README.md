Absolutely! Here’s a refined description of the updated "Scholarship Model" for Regional Partners (RPs), reflecting the changes and integrations as outlined:

### Updated Scholarship Model for Regional Partners

**Overview:**
The Scholarship Model provides funding support directly linked to professional learning activities, with specific conditions tailored to different computer science courses. This model aims to support the delivery of professional learning by RPs while encouraging adaptation and innovation in program delivery.

**CS Principles (CSP) and Computer Science A (CSA):**
- **Standard Allocation**: The scholarship model for CSP and CSA remains largely unchanged, operating under the existing allocation model. RPs will receive a predetermined number of scholarships based on historical data and projected needs.
- **Unlock Additional Scholarships**: RPs have the ability to request additional scholarships beyond their standard allocation based on demonstrated demand or unique opportunities that could increase the impact of CSP and CSA training.

**CS Discoveries (CSD):**
- **Standard CSD Model**: For RPs planning to implement the mostly unmodified CSD professional learning model, which includes a summer workshop and significant academic year workshop components, scholarships need to be specifically requested. This ensures that funding aligns with deliberate planning and expected outcomes.
- **Modified CSD Programs**: If RPs significantly alter the standard CSD professional learning model—whether through format, duration, or content—they are encouraged to seek funding under one of the new funding models designed to support innovation and tailored approaches. This shift is aimed at promoting customized solutions that meet specific district or regional needs.

**National or Multi-region Virtual Workshops:**
- **Split Scholarship Model**: For workshops that are national or cover multiple regions and are hosted virtually, a split scholarship model will be implemented. This model is designed to financially support both the hosting RP responsible for delivering the workshop and the local RPs involved in recruiting and supporting participants from their regions. This ensures that both the organizing and local RPs are compensated for their roles in facilitating broad-reaching professional learning experiences.

**Benefits and Goals:**
- Encourages RPs to maintain high-quality delivery of established programs while also fostering innovation in adapting professional learning to meet local needs.
- Ensures equitable distribution of resources, allowing RPs to expand their reach and impact without the financial burden falling disproportionately on any single entity.
- Supports the strategic vision of broadening access to computer science education through tailored and innovative professional learning strategies.

**Implementation and Oversight:**
- RPs will submit detailed plans and requests for scholarships as part of their annual operational planning. These plans must outline anticipated program delivery formats and expected outcomes.
- Code.org will review scholarship requests to ensure they align with strategic goals and available funding, providing approvals based on a combination of historical performance, potential impact, and alignment with overall program objectives.
- Ongoing evaluation will assess the effectiveness of the scholarship allocations and make adjustments as necessary to optimize the distribution of funds and ensure the success of professional learning initiatives.

This updated Scholarship Model is designed to provide flexibility, encourage innovation, and ensure that funding supports effective and impactful professional learning across various computer science disciplines.
