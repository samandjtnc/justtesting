While I can't create an actual PDF file directly, I can certainly help you draft the text for a detailed policy document that you can then format into a PDF. Here’s a detailed breakdown for the document:

### Detailed Policy Document on New Funding Models

**Code.org Regional Partners Funding Framework Revision 2025**

**Introduction:**
At Code.org, we are committed to expanding access to computer science education across the United States. As part of our strategic initiative to enhance the scalability and sustainability of our impact, we are introducing significant changes to our funding models for Regional Partners (RPs). This document outlines the new funding structures and provides guidance on transitioning to these models.

**1. Overview of Changes:**
As we shift from a teacher-centric to a district-centric approach, our funding models are evolving to support more comprehensive district engagements. This involves a move away from predominantly scholarship-based support to more diversified funding approaches that align with our strategic goals.

**2. New Funding Models:**
Here are the new funding models that will be implemented:

**A. Grant Model with Performance Incentives:**
   - **Purpose:** To provide seed funding for district-level initiatives with additional performance-based incentives.
   - **Details:** RPs will receive upfront funding to cover initial costs of district projects. Additional incentives will be granted based on achievement of specific milestones such as number of districts onboarded, level of engagement, and demonstrable outcomes.
   - **Application Process:** RPs interested in this model must submit a detailed proposal outlining their project scope, expected outcomes, and a clear measurement plan.

**B. Cost Recovery Plus Model:**
   - **Purpose:** To cover the direct costs of delivering services plus an additional percentage to support overhead.
   - **Details:** This model reimburses RPs for the actual costs incurred in conducting workshops and other programs, plus a percentage to cover administrative expenses.
   - **Reporting Requirements:** RPs must provide detailed financial reports justifying the costs incurred and the need for overhead compensation.

**C. Matching Funds Model:**
   - **Purpose:** To leverage district or state funding by matching these contributions, thereby extending the impact of each dollar spent.
   - **Details:** Code.org will match district or state funds up to a predetermined cap to encourage local investment in computer science initiatives.
   - **Eligibility:** Only projects that secure partial funding from district or state sources will qualify for matching funds.

**D. Sliding Scale for Workshops:**
   - **Purpose:** To provide flexible funding for workshops based on participant numbers and workshop scope.
   - **Details:** Funding will vary depending on the size of the workshop, with a lower per-participant cost as participant numbers increase.

**3. Transitioning to New Models:**
   - **Timeline:** These models will be phased in starting January 2025, with full implementation expected by July 2025.
   - **Support Available:** Code.org will provide multiple training sessions and resources to assist RPs in understanding and transitioning to the new funding models.

**4. Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - **Ongoing Assessment:** The effectiveness of these funding models will be regularly evaluated against set performance metrics.
   - **Feedback Mechanism:** RPs are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback on their experiences with the new models to facilitate continuous improvement.

**5. Conclusion:**
The revised funding models are designed to align more closely with our strategic goals of making computer science education more accessible and sustainable. We believe these changes will strengthen our network of Regional Partners and enhance our collective ability to make a lasting impact.
