Subject: Important Updates to Our Funding Models â€“ Join Our Upcoming Webinar

Dear Regional Partners,

I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to evolve and enhance our efforts to expand access to computer science education, we are excited to announce significant updates to our funding models, designed to better support our shift from teacher-centric to district-centric engagements.

**What's Changing?**
This year, we are making strategic adjustments to how we allocate and manage funds within our RP network. Our goal is to foster broader and more sustainable impacts through:
- A diversified funding approach including grants, matching funds, cost recovery, and a sliding scale for workshops.
- A decreased emphasis on direct scholarships for non-district focused activities, redirecting these funds to support scalable district engagements.
- New opportunities through a grant model that rewards effective district-level program implementations.

**Why These Changes?**
Our experience and data from previous years show that a district-centric approach is more effective at creating lasting impacts in computer science education. By adjusting our funding models, we aim to support you, our partners, in implementing more sustainable and impactful initiatives at the district level.

**Learn More at Our Webinar**
We invite you to join us for an informative webinar where we will delve deeper into these changes, discuss what they mean for you, and explain how you can engage with the new models.
